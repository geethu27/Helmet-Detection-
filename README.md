# Helmet-Detection-
Helmet Detection using YOLOv8 is a computer vision project that identifies whether a bike rider is wearing a helmet or not from images, videos, or live camera. The system uses object detection to mark helmet and no helmet cases, helping improve road safety through automatic traffic rule monitoring.
